This is a fork of the libbswabe library by John Bethencourt (http://hms.isi.jhu.edu/acsc/cpabe/).

From the original README:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Right now, the only documentation that exists for this library is the
set of comments in the header file gabe.h. For usage examples, look
through the source of the cpabe package found at the URL below.
